 GuessTheNumber Game
   
   Description
Guess the Number is a simple Java-based game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100. The player has to guess the number within a limited number of attempts. The game gives feedback on whether the guess is "Too High", "Too Low", "Close", or "Too Close". If the player guesses the correct number, they win and can restart the game with a new number.

The game provides a dynamic user interface with a black, white, and green theme for a clean and modern look. The number of attempts, score, and feedback are updated as the player progresses through the game.
